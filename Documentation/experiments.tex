\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Preprocessing}

\subsubsection{Data Augmentation}

The goal for applying this technique is to enhance the robustness of the model against overfitting and improve the performance of the model. However, it resulted to overfitting and worse performance than our current model architecture.

% place image here and discuss the difference between the current model and the model with data augmentation

\subsubsection{Splitting Dataset}

% discuss here how the changing of image size and batch size affected the performance of the model

\subsubsection{Sobel Edge Detection}

The use of Sobel edge detection helped enhance feature recognition and reduced overfitting. 
% state results with applying sobel edge detection vs no sobel edge detection
