	abstract = {Resources for mental health include policy and infrastructure within countries, mental health services, community resources, human resources, and funding. We discuss here the general availability of these resources, especially in low-income and middle-income countries. Government spending on mental health in most of the relevant countries is far lower than is needed, based on the proportionate burden of mental disorders and the availability of cost-effective and affordable interventions. The poorest countries spend the lowest percentages of their overall health budgets on mental health. Most care is now institutionally based, and the transition to community care would require additional funds that have not been made available in most countries. Human resources available for mental health care in most low-income and middle-income countries are very limited, and shortages are likely to persist. Not only are resources for mental health scarce, they are also inequitably distributed—between countries, between regions, and within communities. Populations with high rates of socioeconomic deprivation have the highest need for mental health care, but the lowest access to it. Stigma about mental disorders also constrains use of available resources. People with mental illnesses are also vulnerable to abuse of their human rights. Inefficiencies in the use of available resources for mental health care include allocative and technical inefficiencies in financing mechanisms and interventions, and an overconcentration of resources in large institutions. Scarcity of available resources, inequities in their distribution, and inefficiencies in their use pose the three main obstacles to better mental health, especially in low-income and middle-income countries.},

Our study shows that 10\% of the resources in Open Data portals are labelled as a tabular data of which only 50\% can be considered CSV files. The study inspects the general shape of these tabular data, reports on column and row distribution, analyses the availability of (multiple) header rows and if a file contains multiple tables. In addition, we inspect and analyze the table column types, detect missing values and report about the distribution of the values.},

	abstract = {Researchers investigated the relation between the number of involuntary admissions (detentions) for mental disorders a year under the Mental Health Act 1983 and the number of NHS psychiatric beds each year in England. They used hospital episode statistics from 1996 to 2006 in a retrospective analysis. For each year they obtained the number of available NHS psychiatric beds—defined as those beds for patients with mental disorders or learning disabilities—and the number of involuntary admissions for mental disorders in NHS hospital and private facilities combined.1

It was reported that the number of NHS psychiatric beds fell in each successive year and that overall from 1996 to 2006 the number had decreased by 29\%. A significant correlation existed between the number of psychiatric NHS beds each year and the combined number of involuntary admissions for mental disorders to NHS and private facilities under the Mental Health Act 1983 (Pearson correlation coefficient r =−0.94 (P{\textless}0.001)).

Which of the following statements, if any, are true?

Statements a and b are true, while c and d are false.

The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the strength of linear association between two variables (statement a is true)—in the …},
