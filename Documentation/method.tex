\section{Methodology}

The methodology of this lab exercise follows the usual process for machine learning problems/researches
\[
  \text{data} \to \text{preprocessing} \to \text{modeling} \to \text{evaluation}
\]

The preprocessing section mainly consists of splitting the dataset into training and testing data, checking the validity of data, as well as many others. The Convolutional Neural Network, like other neural networks, can be customized especially in the number of convolutional layers, different pooling methods, different kernels, etc. Unlike previous models, there really isn't much customization that could be done to them other than the hyperparameters to alter slightly how it works. But when it comes to CNNs, there's a lot more room for varying techniques. 

Later in experimentation, we will see how customizing the CNN can affect performance for detecting these hair types. For evaluation, the accuracy metric is used to measure the model's performance.
