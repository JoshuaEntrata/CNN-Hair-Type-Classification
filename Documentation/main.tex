        In this laboratory exercise, we developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify hair types into three categories: Curly, Straight, and Wavy. The dataset presented some challenges, such as a limited number of samples. Our approach involved experimenting various preprocessing and model customization techniques. We constructed a multi-layer CNN and conducted several experiments to evaluate the impact of different preprocessing techniques, hyperparameter adjustments, and architectural configuration on model performance. Evaluation metrics, such as accuracy and loss plots, confusion matrices, and classification reports, were employed to measure the performance of our model. These experiments were strategically designed to achieve high accuracy and reduce overfitting. This exercise not only enhanced our understanding in CNNs for image classifcation but also challenged us to analyze and make decisions about creating an optimal model for practical applications.
