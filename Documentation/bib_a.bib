	abstract = {Artificial intelligence technologies and robot vision systems are core technologies in smart factories. Currently, there is scholarly interest in automatic data feature extraction in smart factories using deep learning networks. However, sufficient training data are required to train these networks. In addition, barely perceptible noise can affect classification accuracy. Therefore, to increase the amount of training data and achieve robustness against noise attacks, a data augmentation method implemented using the adaptive inverse peak signal-to-noise ratio was developed in this study to consider the influence of the color characteristics of the training images. This method was used to automatically determine the optimal perturbation range of the color perturbation method for generating images using weights based on the characteristics of the training images. The experimental results showed that the proposed method could generate new training images from original images, classify noisy images with greater accuracy, and generally improve the classification accuracy. This demonstrates that the proposed method is effective and robust to noise, even when the training data are deficient.},

	abstract = {There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.},
