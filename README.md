# Hair-Type-Classification

## Project Overview
This laboratory exercise develops a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of hair into three categories: Wavy, Curly, and Straight. Using TensorFlow and Keras, we trained our model on a curated dataset of hair images to recognize and classify these hair types accurately.

## Key Features
- **Hair Type Prediction**: Classifies hair into Wavy, Curly, or Straight.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilizes Matplotlib to plot training results for analysis.
- **Image Processing**: Uses Python Imaging Library (PIL) to preprocess images for model training.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL
- LaTeX (for documentation)
